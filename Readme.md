# Conner's Fitness Tracker

## About / Synopsis

I have created a workout tracker, that will require Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## My User story

I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to add multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of diffterent style of exercises. If the exercise involves cardio, I will be able to track how much time it took to reach my gaol and the distance traveled to get there.

## Installation

Packages:

- Mongoose.
